> ### 🏡 The Passion Project
> *"The Personal Coffeshop is born from a simple desire: **to be the ultimate host.** With a move to a new house on the horizon, I wanted a system that lets my friends—connected to my Wi-Fi—order their favorite coffee exactly how they like it.  It transforms my kitchen into a streamlined café, allowing me to focus on crafting the perfect cup rather than remembering who wanted oat milk."*

## 🛠️ The "Host-First" Architecture

Most POS systems are built for profit; this one is built for **hospitality**.

*   **⚡ Zero Latency Performance:** Powered by **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** and **[Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)** (App Router) for near-instant server-side rendering and static delivery.
*   **📡 Real-time Synchronization:** Leveraging **Firestore snapshots** for a "no-refresh" experience. When you click "Preparing" in the kitchen, your friend's phone vibrates in the living room instantly.
*   **� Minimal Hustle Backend:** Managed by **Firebase** for handling authentication, database, and hosting with zero server maintenance—perfect for efficient home hosting.
*   **�📱 PWA Implementation:** Optimized meta tags and manifest allow guests to "Install" the app on their phone for a native feel without an app store download.
*   **🎨 Adaptive Design:** The Guest view is mobile-first, while the Admin Dashboard is optimized for an iPad mounted on the kitchen wall (KDS style).

## ✨ Features Comparison

| Feature | Guest App (Friend) | Admin Dashboard (Host) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Real-time Updates** | Tracks Order Status (Pending → Ready) | Instant Ticket Arrival 🔔 |
| **Persistence** | LocalStorage Cart (Resume later) | Firestore State Sync |
| **Data Usage** | Minimal (Static Assets Cached) | High Density Grid View |
| **Authentication** | Anonymous / Guest Logic | Secure Admin Login |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Bun**: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
*   **Firebase Project**: Authentication (Email + Anonymous), Firestore.

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RohiRIK/Personal-coffeshop.git
cd Personal-coffeshop
bun install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create `.env.local` using your Firebase config:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
...
```

### 3. Database Schema (Firestore)

You need to create these collections or run the seed script (coming soon).

*   **`menu`**: Documents with fields `{ name, price, description, category, available (bool), imageUrl }`
*   **`orders`**: Stores the transactions.
*   **`users`**: Stores user profiles and VIP stats.
*   **`inventory`**: `{ id: "milk_whole", stock: 100 }`

### 4. Running for Guests (Local Wi-Fi) 📡

To let friends access the app, you need to run it on your **local IP address**.

```bash
bun run dev --host 0.0.0.0
```

1.  Find your computer's IP (e.g., `ifconfig` -> `192.168.1.5`).
2.  Tell friends to visit `http://192.168.1.5:3000`.
3.  **Pro Tip**: Generate a QR code for this URL and print it out!

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

*   🖨️ **Thermal Printer Integration**: Auto-print receipts when an order is placed.
*   🗣️ **Voice Commands**: "Hey Siri, order my usual" (via Shortcuts).
*   📊 **Recommendation Engine**: "You usually drink Lattes at this time, want one?"
