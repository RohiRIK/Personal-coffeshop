# ☕ Personal Coffeshop (v2)

The **Personal Coffeshop** is a passion project born from a simple desire: **to be the ultimate host.**

With a move to a new house on the horizon, I wanted to create a system that lets my friends—connected to my Wi-Fi—order their favorite coffee exactly how they like it, directly from their phones. It transforms my home kitchen into a streamlined café, allowing me to focus on crafting the perfect cup rather than remembering who wanted oat milk.
